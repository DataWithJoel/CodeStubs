df.set_index('columnName') will change the Df from using the default index (int 0-N) and instead use the column as the index
Make sure to use inplace=True so your changes persist

use df.loc[index] to get the rows for that index
I guess you need to use iloc(index) if you want to pass it an integer index like the default? TODO investigate this
